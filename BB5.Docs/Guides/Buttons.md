# Button

_[Back to Guides](../Overview.md)_

Buttons are one of the most common UI elements, usually represented as a rectangular area with a label or icon inside, easily distinguishable from other elements on the page. However, they are frequently used as part of a more complex control, such as a search field, date picker, or autocomplete. In these cases, their appearance may vary.

Buttons can be used for various purposes, such as:

- Action buttons: they perform an action when clicked. E.g., submitting a form, saving changes, or deleting an item.
- State buttons: they modify the state of the component or application. E.g., navigating to another page in data grid, or expanding/collapsing a section.
